#Iris - The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.
#Titanic - The titanic and titanic2 data frames describe the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers.
